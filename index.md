# Hi, I'm Effy.
 

## `whoami` 

I'm a **software developer, cyber security consultant, and movement therapist** (personal trainer with a focus on using movement patterns to shift thought patterns). I co-founded a nonprofit that addresses the lack of Consent education. I have produced and launched multiple artists and grassroots groups. I have also climbed 5.12s on lead on slimestone. Now I am doing my best to shift that thirst for hedeonism into a drive for **effective altriusm-based enrepreneurship**. No, this is not techno-utopianism garbage talk but you are right to be skeptical. 

I come from the humanities where the ethics -- not ego --of what you create informs your decision to do so. An avid reader and over-thinker, I believe in 
leveraging the current ease and accessibility for developing software (anyone with internet access can make their idea come into existence barring moonshots) towards projects that address the existential risks of our time: the consolidation of authoritarian power and climate change.

I have a proven track record of project success.

### Here are some deeply unprofessional photos of me where you can't really see what I look like because, what is this? Linkedin? No, this is my static web page made to avoid directing you to Linkedin all the time.
