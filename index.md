# Hi, I'm Effy.


 

# `whoami`

### I am a software developer, cybersecurity consultant, personal trainer, and co-founder of an NGO that offers Consent education. 


# `lsof`


Currently brainstorming on **Prophecy**: https://write.as/riwq8jhgr1j0tw6q.md

&& looking for **introductions to companies, organizations, and individuals working on fighting the status quo role of surveillance capitalism** in fueling rising authoritarian powers. I will do any tech-based volunteer labour on this topic.


# `man formatting`

Yes, I know this page is weirdly formatted. It was free, fast, and the standard `I have better things to do than UI excuse` of my industry.


# `ls` 

Currently, I create **fast, full-stack prototypes for new start-ups**, including backend, web, and mobile (Android and IOS). My stack is React, React-Native, Ruby on Rails, SQL or noSQL (specifically: PostGres, MongoDB, SQLite).

**Previously, I co-founded a nonprofit** that addresses the lack of Consent education. I have **produced and launched multiple artists and grassroots groups**, including the Canadian Polaris Prize winner singer **Lido Pimienta** and the **Where Are You From Collective** who run Toronto's **Asian Zine Fair** and **Chinatown History walk**. I have also climbed 5.12s on lead on slimestone and published prose and poetry in Canadian anthologies and magazines.

Now I am doing my best to shift that thirst for hedonism into a drive for **effective altriusm-based entrepreneurship**. No, this is not techno-utopianism garbage talk but you are right to be skeptical. 

I come from the humanities where the ethics -- not ego --of what you create informs your decision to do so. An avid reader and over-thinker, I believe in leveraging the current ease and accessibility for developing software towards **projects that address the existential risks of our time: the consolidation of authoritarian power and climate change.**

So in corporate-speak: I have a proven track record of multi-domain project success. ;)

I'm working on **Prophecy**, an e2e encrypted and anonymous Whisper network for gender minorities, BIPOC, and LGBTQIA in STEM to discuss encounters with power without fear of reprecussions.

I'm also working on **Day Off:** an app that helps you connect with your community's needs and volunteer opportunities. 

Prototype development Summer 2022. Alpha testers in GTA high schools Fall 2022.
