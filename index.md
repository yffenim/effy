# Prophecy 

### Prophecy is an end-to-end encrypted and anonymous whisper network for women, BIPOC, and LGBTQIA in STEM to discuss encounters with power with fear of reprecussion. 

Think Slack meets Glassdoor — only you are guaranteed the right to privacy and safety.

### The Mission

Prophecy is about having the freedom to communicate about situations of abuse, corruption, harassment, and the myriad forms of aggression that drive minorities to leave STEM. Actually, Let's be real. Women are not a minority; we are half the humans on Earth and yet make up only 29% of the science and engineering workforce. At worst, representation is at 5% (research physics) to 11% (information security).

Talking about danger is how humans have survived. Prophecy is place to have these real conversations, protect each other in the future, and thrive.

### The Team

Effy Min is a software engineer with a humanities education and an activism career. An avid reader and overthinker, she is increasingly troubled by the quiet consolidation of user data for behavioural modification research (or in polite circles: user analytics). 

Axiel Birenbaum is a research physicist applying mathematical and computational methods to material science. In other words, they use the world’s largest computers to understand solids at the smallest scale and design tomorrow’s energy materials. https://aybirenbaum.com/

### How can you help?

We are seeking short, informal interviews of our initial target users to ensure that the project design aligns with your specific needs:
- Women in Software Engineering
- Women in Electrical Engineering
- Women in Nuclear Engineering
- Women in Information (Cyber) Security
- Women STEM Research/Academia. 
- or WOPOC/LGBTQIA in any STEM field

If you are or you know someone whose voice should be heard, please contact Effy at: effymmin@protonmail.com

Or schedule an interview with Effy at: https://calendly.com/effymin and leave your contact in the notes.
